# Overview
This repository contains an SQL project that analyzes the Indian Census 2011 dataset. The project focuses on extracting valuable insights related to demographic factors, literacy rates, growth rates, sex ratios, and population density across different states in India.

Tools Used: SQL Server

Key Objectives
Average Literacy Rate by State: Calculate and analyze the average literacy rate for each state.

Growth Rate Analysis: Examine the growth rates of different states to identify trends and variations.

Average Sex Ratio by State: Determine the average sex ratio (number of females per 1000 males) for each state.

Total Population Estimation: Calculate the total population for each state and provide an overall demographic overview.

Top 3 and Bottom 3 States in Literacy and Growth Rate: Identify and list the top three and bottom three states based on literacy rate and growth rate.

Total Male and Female Population: Break down the population by gender to understand the distribution.

Population Per Area: Analyze population density by calculating the population per unit area for each state.

Project Structure
Queries: Stores specific SQL queries used in the analysis.
Data:: Placeholder for the Indian Census 2011 dataset or a link to the dataset source.
README.md: Detailed documentation providing information on the dataset, schema, and instructions for running the SQL scripts.
